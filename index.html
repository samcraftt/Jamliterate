      you will be able to create an account and save your data 
      for a more personalized learning experience each time you log in.</p>
    <p style="text_align:left;"> Flash Draw: Our mobile application will
      allow you to take stylus-written notes on the fly, so you don't have
      to turn your class notes into flashcards later.</p>
    <p style="text_align:left;"> Intelligent Study Buddy: This AI-powered study
      tool will help you prepare for common standardized tests, providing specific
      types of questions based on your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
    <p style="text_align:left;"> Card Composer: To waste no time creating review materials,
      users will be able to feed our AI Card Composer text for it to automatically
      build a comprehensive flashcard set.</p>
    <p style="text_align:left;"> Rapid Review: For our procrastinators and crammers, we plan to 
      implement a tool that condenses a large flashcard set into a smaller set that groups together
      the main ideas for last-minute studying.</p>
